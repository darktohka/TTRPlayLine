# TTRPlayLine

TTRPlayLine is a Java web server that uses the NanoHTTPD web server framework. It automatically attends to your Toontown Rewritten playline, ensuring that you continue to have a valid token that can be used to play the game at all times.

Accounts can be easily added by setting your Toontown Rewritten cookie information inside the config file `settings.json`.

The web server itself uses the GitHub Markdown CSS framework to serve required management information.
